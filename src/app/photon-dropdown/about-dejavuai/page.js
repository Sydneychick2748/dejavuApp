            <h1>Our proprietary technology, DejaVuAIÂ®, is useful as a stand-alone search capability or could be used in an enterprise environment (Cloud/VM) for image comparison and search. Using our scripting API, our technology can be paired with other databases and analytics to achieve drastic efficiency and accuracy for image recognition. This new algorithm is much faster than traditional methods for finding identical and similar images based on feature recognition (SIFT, etc.) and Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML).</h1>
